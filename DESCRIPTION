Description: BenchJournal is a tool to keep track of benchmarks for a package as
  the package is developed. This is useful when aiming to refactor
  code, or convert R code to C/C++, and wish to monitor progress. Two workflows
  are supported: an automatic workflow which will update benchmark results
  when git push is ran, and a manual workflow which asssumes the R package
  version has been updated between updates.
