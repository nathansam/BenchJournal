# BenchJournal

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

BenchJournal is a tool to keep track of package benchmarks as the package is
developed.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BenchJournal with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nathansam/BenchJournal")
```

## Using BenchJournal

BenchJournal can be set up using a simple function which will create
folders/files need to journal your package's progress in `/man/BenchJournal/`
and will add these folders/ files to your `.Rbuildignore`. 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
BenchJournal::Init()
```

Inside `/man/BenchJournal/`, you will now find a folder `scripts`. Save any R
scripts to this directory which you wish to benchmark (I.E. a script which uses
the functions in your package which you are intending to improve the performance
of).

Run `NewEntry` to add an entry to your journal file (located at
`/man/BenchJournal/`).
```{r, eval = FALSE}
BenchJournal::NewEntry()
```

After making changes to your package, update the version of your package, and
re-run `NewEntry` to add to your journal. 

An interactive boxplot of your benchmark results using ggplot and plotly can
then be generated by using:

```{r, eval = F}
BenchJournal::JournalBoxPlot()
```
